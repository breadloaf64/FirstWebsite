                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    Back in 2022 when I was in my final year of undergrad (Maths
                    and Computer Science at the University of Bristol), I
                    undertook an individual project. I was free to choose the
                    subject and direction, and so I chose to do something that
                    links my interest in music to programming. This is what I
                    came up with!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to my supervisor Dr Pete Bennett for steering me in
                    some cool directions that I never would have found by
                    myself!
                </p>

                <p>
                    A note on accessibility: Much of the stuff I made for the
                    project has interfaces build within p5.js. Unfortunately
                    this makes them very hard to access unless you can use a
                    mouse and can read the onscreen text. These days I know
                    better!

                <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

                <p>
                    If you’re a music nerd like me and frequent the youtube
                    music theory rabbit hole, you may have come across the new
                    trend of drawing pictures and text using

                    jargon, but sometimes it is the quickest way to explain
                    things). The earliest example I know of (Feb 2017) is
                    Savant’s

                        >Bird in the Rain</a
                    >, which both looks and sounds delightful. Andrew huang made
                    a
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/lVybwjl_GI0">great video</a>
                    about his own version and the creative process behind it.
                    Recently, people have taken the idea further by performing
                    these sequences live, so that the audience can watch the
                    drawing unfurl before their very eyes in real time. Some
                    good examples are Jacob Collier’s

                    Inspired by this new “genre” exploring the synergy between
                    audio and visuals, I set out to create an app that does the
                    inverse of this. The app will take a photo of a drawing on a
                    piece of paper and convert those lines into pitch
                    information. Hopefully, using a few musical tricks, the
                    output will sound melodious! At the very least, the app can
                    serve as an inspiration tool, generating melodies that you
                    might not have thought of otherwise. I called the app draw
                    music!

                <h2>Experimenting in P5.js</h2>

                <p>
                    I knew I wanted to host the app on the web, and at the time
                    I was well acquainted with a library called p5.js, which was
                    easy to develop interactive graphics for websites. So I
                    decided that my app would be implemented using it (though I
                    now realise I should have created the majority of the UI
                    using standard html).
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, before diving in to the main project, I began
                    tinkering with some mini projects which allowed to me to
                    become acquainted with p5.js, as well as its sound and image
                    libraries and see what kind of interactions the user can
                    have. Here they are - have a play!

                <h2>draw music!</h2>

                <p>
                    Finally I was ready to implement the app itself, using all
                    the things I'd learned whilst creating the experiments. I
                    worked on polish, and had a particular focus on allowing it
                    to work on both desktop and mobile. Given the UI was build
                    from scratch within p5.js, this required a lot of maths!
                </p>

                <p>Without further waffle, here is the app:</p>

                <div class="drawMusicTile">
                    <a href="projectWelcome.html">

                            alt=""
                        />
                        draw music!
                    </a>
