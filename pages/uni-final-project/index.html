                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>
                        Back in 2022 when I was in my final year of undergrad
                        (Maths and Computer Science at the University of
                        Bristol), I undertook an individual project. I was free
                        to choose the subject and direction, and so I chose to
                        do something that links my interest in music to
                        programming. This is what I came up with!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Thanks to my supervisor Dr Pete Bennett for steering me
                        in some cool directions that I never would have found by
                        myself!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A note on accessibility: Much of the stuff I made for
                        the project has interfaces build within p5.js.
                        Unfortunately this makes them very hard to access unless
                        you can use a mouse and can read the onscreen text.
                        These days I know better!

                    <h2>The Inspiration</h2>

                    <p>
                        If you’re a music nerd like me and frequent the youtube
                        music theory rabbit hole, you may have come across the
                        new trend of drawing pictures and text using
                        <a
                            href="https://cecm.indiana.edu/361/midi.html#:~:text=MIDI%20is%20an%20acronym%20that,each%20other%2C%20using%20MIDI%20messages."
                            >midi</a
                        >
                        on a
                        <a
                            href="https://www.admiralbumblebee.com/music/2018/06/24/30-days-with-FLStudio-20-Piano-Roll-Basics.html#what-is-a-piano-roll-and-what-should-it-do"
                            >piano roll</a
                        >. (a forewarning, I will attempt not to use too much
                        jargon, but sometimes it is the quickest way to explain
                        things). The earliest example I know of (Feb 2017) is
                        Savant’s
                        <a
                            href="https://twitter.com/savantofficial/status/834284637450969089"
                            >Bird in the Rain</a
                        >, which both looks and sounds delightful. Andrew huang
                        made a
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/lVybwjl_GI0">great video</a>
                        about his own version and the creative process behind
                        it. Recently, people have taken the idea further by
                        performing these sequences live, so that the audience
                        can watch the drawing unfurl before their very eyes in
                        real time. Some good examples are Jacob Collier’s
                        <a

                        Inspired by this new “genre” exploring the synergy
                        between audio and visuals, I set out to create an app
                        that does the inverse of this. The app will take a photo
                        of a drawing on a piece of paper and convert those lines
                        into pitch information. Hopefully, using a few musical
                        tricks, the output will sound melodious! At the very
                        least, the app can serve as an inspiration tool,
                        generating melodies that you might not have thought of
                        otherwise.

                    <h2>The Experiments</h2>

                    <p>
                        My project was implemented in p5.js, so that it could be
                        hosted on my website for anyone to play with. However,
                        before diving in to the main project, I began tinkering
                        with some little sound experiences which allowed to me
                        to become acquainted with p5.js sound libraries and see
                        what kind of interactions the user can have with sound.
