                    My name’s Peter, I’m a Mathematics and Computer science
                    undergrad at Bristol university, and I have made this app
                    for my final individual project. The idea is to provide a
                    novel interface for music writing, lowering the barrier to
                    entry so that users without musical knowledge or access to
                    specialist software and equipment can explore and create
                    something cool!

                        around 10-20 minutes. Of course, if you're enjoying
                        yourself, you may use it as much as you like. You don't
                        need to set aside a time or place to do it, you can use
                        it whenever inspiration strikes!
                    </li>
                    <li>
