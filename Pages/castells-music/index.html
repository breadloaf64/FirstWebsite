                <p>
                    I'm trying to scrape together and collate some resources
                    that are useful for someone learning to play music for
                    castells. I'm sure there's plenty of good stuff online, but
                    as a non-catalan speaker, I find it hard to locate, let
                    alone understand! So here is my best attempt to make an
                    English resource for castells musicians. Now, I am not of
                    the Catalan culture and I only started taking part in
                    Castells in the summer of 2023, so I cannot authentically
                    represent traditions and culture. All mistakes are my own.
                </p>

                    Thanks to David Vivanco for teaching me all I know about
                    castells music.

                    things to move and shift and change, but please use it for
                    your learning if it helps!

                <h2 id="the-gralla">The Gralla</h2>

                <p>
                    The gralla is the main melody instrument in castells music.
                    It is a double reeded instrument like an oboe, and it is
                    remarkably loud - which makes it very easy for the the
                    castellers to hear it, even outside in a crowded square. It
                    shares its name with the jackdaw.
                </p>

                <p>The gralla is made up of several parts:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The inxa</strong>, also known as the canya, is
                        the set of two reeds that product the instrument's
                        sound. The reeds are delicately thin and bound together
                        in a coloured thred. The colour of the thread indicates
                        how hard the reeds are to play.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The tudel</strong> is a metal conical tube that
                        joins the inxa to the body of the instrument. Usually it
                        is attached to a cork on one end which slots into the
                        body, and the inxa gets pushed onto the pointy end.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The cos</strong> is the main body of the
                        instrument.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>The campana</strong> is the end of the
                        instrument, which amplifies the sound.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Here are some nursery rhymes. See if you can play them.
                    They’re patronisingly simple but they are useful for getting
                    used to the finger positions (“fingerings”). First is “Mary
                    had a little lamb” in two keys.
