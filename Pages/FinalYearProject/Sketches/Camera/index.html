                    Obviously a key component to the app is camera access, so
                    that we can take pictures of the drawings! I did this by
                    creating “capture”, which is a &lt;video&gt; DOM element in
                    the webpage. Since this element sits on the page separate
                    from the canvas, to show the camera output in our sketch we
                    must hide it and anstead print the data onto the canvas.
                    This is easily done with p5.js.
                </p>
                <p class="sketch-info">
                    The hard part was making it responsive. We want to be able
                    to access both the front and back cameras on a smartphone.
                    We also want to make sure that the video captured by the
                    camera sits cleanly on our page. So any time the user taps
                    to switch camera, or resizes the webpage we must
                    reinitialize this “capture” object with new parameters as
                    appropriate. Finally I flipped the image output for the
                    selfie camera, as per convention.

                    As simple as this sketch is, it took a lot of headache and
                    trial and error to figure out!
