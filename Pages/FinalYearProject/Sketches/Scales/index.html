            <!-- Sketch info -->
            <p>The focus behind this sketch was pitch quantisation. That is, how can we map the continuous spectrum of pitch onto a musical scale? This will become important if we want to use the final program to come up with harmonious melodies.</p>
            <p>To make this work, I came up with a way to index notes. By convection we start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)">A4</a> (440hz) which we index note with 0. Then the semitone up is index 1, the next index 2 and so on. In the same way, the semitone below is index -1 etc. So each musical note is given an integer.</p>
            <p>The second part of the puzzle is a continuous bijection between frequencies and notes (including the real numbers between note indices). There are many ways to do this, but the standard western way is by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament">12-tone equal temperament</a> (12-TET). You can spend hours in the music theory rabbit hole of why this works, but hereâ€™s the function f which maps notes to frequencies where n is the index of a note: f(n) =  440 * (sqrt(2))^n.</p>
            <p>So to quantise a frequency to the chromatic scale, apply f^-1(freq) to get the real value of the note. Round it, to get the index of the nearest note in the scale, then apply f again to get the quantised frequency.</p>
            <p>Finally, in order to quantise to a scale, I created a Scale class, which takes a set of notes in one octave relative to some tonic (root) note and generates an array of all the notes in the scale across all octaves in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range">audible range</a>. We can then use binary search to get the nearest note in the scale to a given note!</p>
