            <!-- Sketch info -->
            <p>The focus behind this sketch was pitch quantisation. That is, how can we map the continuous spectrum of pitch onto a discrete musical scale? This will become important if we want to use the final program to come up with harmonious melodies.</p>
            <p>To make this work, I first came up with a way to index notes. By convention we start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard)">A4 (440hz)</a> to which we assign index 0. Then the semitone up has index 1, the next index 2 and so on. In the same way, the semitone below has index -1 etc. So each musical note is given an integer.</p>
            <p>The second part of the puzzle is a continuous bijection between frequencies and notes (including the real numbers between note indices). There are many ways to do this, but the one I chose is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament">12-tone equal temperament (12-TET)</a>. You can spend hours in the music theory rabbit hole of why this works, but hereâ€™s the function f which maps note index n to its frequency: f(n)=440*(sqrt(2))^n.</p>
            <p>Altogether, to quantise a frequency to the chromatic scale, apply f^-1(freq) to get the real-valued unquantised note index. Round it to the nearest note index, then apply f again to get the quantised frequency.</p>
            <p>Finally, in order to quantise to a scale I created a Scale class. It takes a tonic (root note of the scale) and a set of notes in one octave relative to that tonic and generates an array of all the notes in the scale across all octaves in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range">audible range</a>. We can then use binary search to get the nearest note in the scale to a given note!</p>
