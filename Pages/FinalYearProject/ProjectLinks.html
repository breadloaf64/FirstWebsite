        My project was implemented in p5.js,  so that anyone can play with is on my
        website! However, before diving in to the main project, I began tinkered
        with some little sound experiences! This allowed to me to become
        acquainted with p5.js sound libraries and see what kind of interactions
        the user can have with sound.
