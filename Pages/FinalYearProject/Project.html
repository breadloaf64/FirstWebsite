            <p>
                My project was implemented in p5.js,  so that it could be hosted on my website for anyone to play with!
                However, before diving in to the main project, I began tinkering
                with some little sound experiences! This allowed to me to become
                acquainted with p5.js sound libraries and see what kind of interactions
                the user can have with sound.
