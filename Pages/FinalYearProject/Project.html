            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>Hey, my name’s Peter. I’m (as of writing this) a final year undergrad Maths and Computer Science student at the University of Bristol, and this is the website for my final project!</p>
            <p>
                If you’re a music nerd like me and frequent the youtube music theory rabbit hole, you may have come across the new trend of drawing pictures and text using <a href = "https://cecm.indiana.edu/361/midi.html#:~:text=MIDI%20is%20an%20acronym%20that,each%20other%2C%20using%20MIDI%20messages.">midi</a> on a <a href = "https://www.admiralbumblebee.com/music/2018/06/24/30-days-with-FLStudio-20-Piano-Roll-Basics.html#what-is-a-piano-roll-and-what-should-it-do">piano roll</a>. (a forewarning, I will attempt not to use too much jargon, but sometimes it is the best way to explain things). The earliest example I know of (Feb 2017) is Savant’s <a href = "https://twitter.com/savantofficial/status/834284637450969089">Bird in the Rain</a>, which both looks and sounds delightful. Andrew huang made a <a href="https://youtu.be/lVybwjl_GI0">great video</a> about his own version and the creative process behind it. Recently, people have taken the idea further by performing these sequences live, so that the audience can watch the drawing unfurl before their very eyes in real time. Some good examples are Jacob Collier’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobcollier/status/1345095162524037120">Happy 2021</a>, and GLASYS’ <a href = "https://youtube.com/shorts/Ij_0gxbzxXo?feature=share">Pacman drawing</a>.

            <p>
                My project was implemented in p5.js,  so that it could be hosted on my website for anyone to play with!
                However, before diving in to the main project, I began tinkering
                with some little sound experiences! This allowed to me to become
                acquainted with p5.js sound libraries and see what kind of interactions
                the user can have with sound.
