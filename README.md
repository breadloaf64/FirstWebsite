This project is made with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and the build static website is deployed to GitHub pages.

# Development

To run in dev mode (with live update and hot reloading courtesy of Vite) use `npm run dev`

At the minute the project is develped using node 18. This is relevant for deployment, because the build step in the workflow requires a node version.

# Deployment

The project is deployed using a GitHub action according to [instructions on the Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/).
